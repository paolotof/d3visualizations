# d3visualizations
Repository with d3.js visualizations which I like or for which I wrote a post on my [blog](https://paolotoffanin.wordpress.com/)

The visualizations can be seen following the links to the following pages:

* [Global warming streamGraph animated](http://paolo.mp-concepts.net/dataVis/globalWarmingStreamGraph_animated.html "animated streamgraph")
* [Global warming streamGraph interactive](http://paolo.mp-concepts.net/dataVis/globalWarmingStreamGraph.html "interactive streamgraph")
* [Reaction time differences scatterplot](http://paolo.mp-concepts.net/dataVis/rtWordsNnWords.html "4D in 2D scatterplot")
